        <title>Being a Developer after 40</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do not worry about hype. Keep doing your thing, keep learning what you were learning, and move on. Pay attention to it only if you have a genuine interest, or if you feel that it could bring you some benefit in the medium or long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this lies in the fact that, as the Romans said in the past, Nil nove sul sole. Most of what you see and learn in computer science has been around for decades, and this fact is purposedly hidden beneath piles of marketing, books, blog posts and questions on Stack Overflow. Every new architecture is just a reimagination and a readaptation of an idea that was floating around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
